Nine-Nine's Not-So-Silent Interrogation: A Case for Captain Holt's Finest
The Scenario:

Captain Raymond Holt has summoned you, his most trusted detective. A concerning file has arrived from none other than Douglas Judy, the notorious Pontiac Bandit. In a surprising turn of events, Judy claims Jake Peralta was singing during his interrogation and now offers to surrender... to a specific detective. But something about the attached video file seems off.

The Evidence:

The file appears to be a security camera recording from the interrogation room. Jake Peralta is indeed present, but the audio quality is glitchy and distorted. Captain Holt suspects a hidden message within the corrupted audio.

I hear whispers where none should be,
Not in the song, but the static symphony.
The culprit's mistake, a keen ear will find,
A hidden message, disguised, not of its kind
Peralta's charm, a mere smokescreen, it seems,
The truth lies not in his voice, but in corrupted dreams.
Focus on the flaws, the glitches that bind,
For a hidden pattern, the message you'll find.

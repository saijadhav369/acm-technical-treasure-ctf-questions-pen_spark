In the heart of the forest, where deer gracefully tread,
A tome of secrets lies, its pages unread.
An image of beauty, with eyes that gleam bright,
Yet deeper within, concealed from sight.

In its digital canvas, a key does lie,
But not in the open, so don't just rely.
To unlock its mysteries, delve into the code,
Where archives entwine, in a cryptic abode.

Seek out the cipher of seven zips strong,
Where encryption guards, holding secrets for long.
With unwavering patience and a sharp-eyed gaze,
Extract the hidden key from its intricate maze.

Embark on the journey, decipher this clue,
For the link to the next, awaits just for you.
In the silent gaze of the deer, therein lies,
The pathway forward, veiled under skies.

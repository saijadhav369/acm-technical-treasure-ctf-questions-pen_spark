## ACM Technical Treasure Hunt CTF Challenges

This repository contains two Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges designed for the ACM Technical Treasure Hunt Event. 

**Challenge 06: Nine-Nine's Not-So-Silent Interrogation: A Case for Captain Holt's Finest**

**The Scenario:**

Captain Raymond Holt, your trusted detective superior, has summoned you. A concerning file from the infamous Pontiac Bandit, Douglas Judy, has arrived. In a surprising turn of events, Judy claims Jake Peralta was singing during his interrogation and now offers to surrender... to a specific detective. However, Captain Holt suspects something fishy about the attached video file.

**The Evidence:**

The file appears to be a security camera recording from the interrogation room. While Jake Peralta is present, the audio quality is distorted and glitchy. Captain Holt believes a hidden message is embedded within the corrupted audio.

**Challenge:**

* Analyze the provided video file drive link in the text files attached as "question06".
* Focus on the audio glitches and distortions to uncover a hidden message.
* The poem provides hints about the nature of the message and where to find it.

**Challenge 07: Secrets in the Forest**

**The Scenario:**

Deep within the heart of the forest, a hidden tome of secrets awaits discovery. Its beautiful cover with gleaming eyes hides a deeper truth. 

**The Clue:**

The provided image holds the key, but not in plain sight. You'll need to delve into the image's digital code to find the key.

**Challenge:**

* Examine the provided image file for hidden information.
* The poem provides clues about the type of information to look for and the format it might be in. 
* Focus on the concept of "seven zips" and "archives" within the code.

**Important Note:**

The links to the video and image files are unavailable in this public repository due to security reasons. Please refer to the official ACM Technical Treasure Hunt event resources to access the challenge files.

**Good Luck!**
